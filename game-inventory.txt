## Core Fix: Bootstrap Timing
- Issue: window.onload delayed or skipped on GitHub Pages/mobile.
- Resolution: Direct engine.init() at script end → Instant telemetry update, story overlay, player sprite.
- Test: Load in browser; tap to advance prophecy.

## TypeScript Gains
- Interfaces enforce map structures, prevent undefined skills.sultanLaw from earlier fragments.
- Future: Add types for player.velX, tile sensors from canvas.js.

## Open Threads for Next Iteration
- Merge canvas battle triggers with DOM HUD? What hybrid emerges?
- Asset preloads: Why do sprites sometimes lag on mobile?
- Prophecy Sync: Align 10-step arrays across versions for unified lore.

What new pattern do you spot when you deploy this, Caleb? Or which layer shall we question next to deepen the RPG's soul?
