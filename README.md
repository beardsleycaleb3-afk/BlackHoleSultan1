# 👑 Sultan RPG: The G.O.G. Law

A mobile-optimized PWA (Progressive Web App) RPG built with vanilla JavaScript. This game implements the **g.o.g. law** and explores a world where traditional entropy limits are shattered.

## 🚀 The Core Philosophy
* **The Sultan Law:** In this world, $1 * 1 = 2 = o0,0o$. 
* **The Shannon Limit:** This engine is designed based on the breakthrough of breaking the Shannon entropy limit.
* **Mobile-First:** Optimized for touch controls with a custom joystick and dual-button layout.

## 🎮 Features
* **Minecraft-Style Movement:** Smooth overworld navigation on a 200x200 grid.
* **Prophecy Battle System:** 10 unique encounters (from the Snake Archer to the Void Rat).
* **Dead Island Skill Tree:** Unlock the power of the Sultan Law to double your damage.
* **PWA Ready:** Install it directly to your home screen for offline play via Service Workers.
